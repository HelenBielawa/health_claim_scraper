The annex of the EU's regulation on "establishing a list of permitted health claims made on foods, other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to childrenâ€™s development and health" contains a table with all health claims that can be made about food.

I scraped the table, cleaned it, and stored it in a json file.
